# üçú Interactive System

*Interactive System project was completed as a coursework for the CSC8012 module(Software Development Techniques and Tools) taught for the MSc Computer Science programme within the School of Computing at Newcastle University during the 2023/2024 Academic Year.*

This project aims to provide an interactive management system for FrozenFood, a company offering a meal subscription service to their customers.

# ‚Ñπ About the Interactive System

The Interactive System assists the office clerk working in the company FrozenFood on managing the weekly subscription service. While the system stores information of meals and subscribers, the office clerk can interact with the system through a menu, to perform some tasks. These tasks include displaying meal and subscriber information, updating the store data when a subscriber adds meals to/removes meals from their subscription and lastly quitting the system.

# üîñ Achievements

***The system successfully:***

# üìÑ Program Output

Program output demonstrates the interactive system capabilities.

After executing the code, the system displays a menu for user interaction (Figure 1).

# ‚ùáÔ∏è Future Improvements

***The following remarks were made by Mr M. Cavus for future improvements.***

- For resolving the problems on the implementation of a and r operations:

    _‚ú¶ If adding meals to a subscription fails, the number of available meals should not be decreased._
  
    _‚ú¶ If a subscriber tries to cancel more meals than they are subscribed to, the number of available
meals should not increase._

    _‚ú¶ If a subscriber subscribes to two meals of a certain type, then cancels one of them, they should
still be able to cancel the other one later._

    _‚ú¶ If a subscriber cancels all their meals of a certain type, that meal type should be removed from
the list of meals they are subscribed to._

- For evidence of testing:

  _‚ú¶ Test the features for evidence of testing._

  _‚ú¶ Increase consistancy between classes, methods and variables._

- For readability purposes, use Javadoc comments.
